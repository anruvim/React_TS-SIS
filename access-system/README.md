## Flexible User Access System

Our flexible user access system is designed to provide dynamic and manageable access control for users. Unlike hardcoded access, this system allows administrators to manage user permissions at any time through an intuitive interface.

#### Key Features:

1. **Page Management**:
   - **Dynamic Page Creation**: Administrators can create new pages within the system by specifying a name, icon, and path.
   - **API Path Control**: Each page can have a list of associated API paths that can be accessed from it. This adds an extra layer of security by controlling user access to specific APIs.

2. **User Groups**:
   - **Group-Based Access**: Users are organized into groups, and each group can have customized navigation menu links and sub-page links.
   - **Granular Permissions**: Administrators can set Read, Write, and Delete permissions for each path, ensuring users can only view and access the links they are authorized to.

This system provides a robust and flexible way to manage user access, ensuring security and ease of administration.
